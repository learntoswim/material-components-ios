[Contained buttons](https://material.io/components/buttons/#contained-button) are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

### Contained button example

To achieve a contained button use the contained button theming method on the MDCButton theming extension. To access the theming extension see the [Theming section](#theming).
