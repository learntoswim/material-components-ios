[Text buttons](https://material.io/components/buttons/#text-button) are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located in dialogs and cards. In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.

### Text button example

To achieve a text button use the text button theming method on the MDCButton theming extension. To access the theming extension see the [Theming section](#theming).
